Peanut Butter and Jelly

2 slices      - enriched white bread
1 boat load - peanut butter
1 boat load - jelly of your choice

First, remove the two slices of your unhealthy but delicious enriches white bread from the store-brand bread bag... because you definitely didn't bake it and you undoubtedly didn't get the name brand.
Second, put a boat load of peanut butter on one side of one of the slices of bread and spread it around so it is evenly distributed across the bread surface. Put this slice of bread to the side for now.
Third, put a boat load of jelly on the unused slice of bread on one of the sides. spread this around so it is evenly distributed across the bread surface. Hold onto this slice for now.
Next, take the two slices of bread and put them together so that the peanut butter side is touching the jelly side on the other slice of bread. 
Lastly, wrap half of your sandwich in a napkin, leaving half of the sandwich exposed for consumption. This will help keep the large amounts of peanut butter and jelly inside of the sandwich and off of your lap.
While you enjoy the sandwich, remember to pull the napkin down so you do not consume any paper products.
